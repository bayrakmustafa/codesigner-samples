# Sign with CodeSignTool

[![GitHub Actions Docker Status](https://github.com/bayrakmustafa/codesigner-docker/workflows/Docker%20Image%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bayrakmustafa/codesigner-docker)
[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/bayrakmustafa/codesigner-samples.svg?style=plastic&label=Travis%20CI&branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/bayrakmustafa/codesigner-samples)

CodeSignTool is a secure, privacy-oriented multi-platform Java command line utility for remotely signing Microsoft Authenticode and Java code objects with eSigner EV code signing certificates. Hashes of the files are sent to SSL.com for signing so that the code itself is not sent. This is ideal where sensitive files need to be signed, but should not be sent over the wire for signing. CodeSignTool is also ideal for automated batch processes for high volume signings or integration into existing CI/CD pipeline workflows.

Docker image is used for code signing with CircleCI. Detailed information: https://github.com/bayrakmustafa/codesigner-docker

# Usage (Job)

<!-- start usage -->
```yaml
- stage: sign
  # The job name
  name: sign-dotnet-artifacts
  # The Ubuntu distribution to use
  dist: bionic
  # Use docker command for signing   
  services:
    - docker
  # Defines environment variables for specific jobs.
  env:
    COMMAND="sign"
  # Use dotnet-cli to build the project
  language: csharp
  # Disable mono installation
  mono: none
  # Dotnet version to build the project
  dotnet: 3.1.419
  # Before script to run before building the project
  before_script: 
    # Created directories for artifacts
    - mkdir -p ${TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR}/artifacts
    - mkdir -p ${TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR}/packages
  # Script to build the project
  script: 
    # Docker Pull CodeSigner Docker Image
    - docker pull ghcr.io/bayrakmustafa/codesigner:latest
    # Sign artifact with CodeSigner docker image
    - docker run -i --rm --dns 8.8.8.8 --network host --volume ${TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR}/packages:/codesign/examples

      -e ENVIRONMENT_NAME=${ENVIRONMENT_NAME} ghcr.io/bayrakmustafa/codesigner:latest ${COMMAND} 
      -input_file_path=/codesign/examples/${PROJECT_NAME}.dll -output_dir_path=/codesign/output
  # Used to specify a list of files and directories that should be attached to the job if it succeeds.
  workspaces:
    use:
      - dotnet-artifacts
    create:
      name: dotnet-signed-artifacts
      paths:
        # Save signed artifact
        - ${TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR}/artifacts/${PROJECT_NAME}.dll
```
<!-- end usage -->

### Environment Variables

* `USERNAME`: SSL.com account username. (**Required**)

* `PASSWORD`: SSL.com account password (**Required**)

* `CREDENTIAL_ID`: Credential ID for signing certificate. If credential_id is omitted and the user has only one eSigner code signing certificate, CodeSignTool will default to that. If the user has more than one code signing certificate, this parameter is mandatory. (**Required**)

* `TOTP_SECRET`: OAuth TOTP Secret. You can access detailed information on https://www.ssl.com/how-to/automate-esigner-ev-code-signing (**Required**)

* `ENVIRONMENT_NAME` : 'TEST' or 'PROD' Environment. (**Required**)

### Inputs

* `input_file_path`: Path of code object to be signed. (**Required**)

* `output_dir_path`: Directory where signed code object(s) will be written. If output_path is omitted, the file specified in -file_path will be overwritten with the signed file.
