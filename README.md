# Sign with CodeSignTool

[![GitHub Actions Status](https://github.com/bayrakmustafa/codesigner-samples/workflows/CodeSignTool/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bayrakmustafa/codesigner-samples)

CodeSignTool is a secure, privacy-oriented multi-platform Java command line utility for remotely signing Microsoft Authenticode and Java code objects with eSigner EV code signing certificates. Hashes of the files are sent to SSL.com for signing so that the code itself is not sent. This is ideal where sensitive files need to be signed, but should not be sent over the wire for signing. CodeSignTool is also ideal for automated batch processes for high volume signings or integration into existing CI/CD pipeline workflows.

This action provides the sign artifacts with CodeSignTool.

# Usage

<!-- start usage -->
```yaml
- name: Sign Artifact with CodeSignTool
  uses: sslcom/actions-codesigner@develop
  with:
    # CodeSignTool Commands:
    # - get_credential_ids: Output the list of eSigner credential IDs associated with a particular user.
    # - credential_info: Output key and certificate information related to a credential ID.
    # - sign: Sign and timestamp code object.
    # - batch_sign: Sign and timestamp multiple code objects with one OTP.
    # - hash: Pre-compute hash(es) for later use with batch_hash_sign command.
    # - batch_sign_hash: Sign hash(es) pre-computed with hash command.
    command: sign

    # SSL.com account username
    username: ${{secrets.ES_USERNAME}}

    # SSL.com account password.
    password: ${{secrets.ES_PASSWORD}}

    # Credential ID for signing certificate.
    credential_id: ${{secrets.CREDENTIAL_ID}}

    # OAuth TOTP Secret (https://www.ssl.com/how-to/automate-esigner-ev-code-signing)
    totp_secret: ${{secrets.ES_TOTP_SECRET}}

    # Path of code object to be signed.
    # Supported File Types: acm, ax, bin, cab, cpl, dll, drv, efi, exe, mui, ocx, scr, sys, tsp, msi, ps1, ps1xml, js, vbs, wsf, jar
    file_path: ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/test/src/build/HelloWorld.jar

    # Directory where signed code object(s) will be written.
    output_path: ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/artifacts
```
<!-- end usage -->

### Inputs

* `username`: SSL.com account username (**Required**)

* `password`: SSL.com account password (**Required**)

* `credential_id`: Credential ID for signing certificate. If credential_id is omitted and the user has only one eSigner code signing certificate, CodeSignTool will default to that. If the user has more than one code signing certificate, this parameter is mandatory.

* `totp_secret`: OAuth TOTP Secret. You can access detailed information on https://www.ssl.com/how-to/automate-esigner-ev-code-signing (**Required**)

* `file_path`: Path of code object to be signed. (**Required**)

* `output_path`: Directory where signed code object(s) will be written. If output_path is omitted, the file specified in -file_path will be overwritten with the signed file.
