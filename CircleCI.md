# Sign with CodeSignTool

[![GitHub Actions Docker Status](https://github.com/bayrakmustafa/codesigner-docker/workflows/Docker%20Image%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bayrakmustafa/codesigner-docker)
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/bayrakmustafa/codesigner-samples/tree/main.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/bayrakmustafa/codesigner-samples/tree/main)

CodeSignTool is a secure, privacy-oriented multi-platform Java command line utility for remotely signing Microsoft Authenticode and Java code objects with eSigner EV code signing certificates. Hashes of the files are sent to SSL.com for signing so that the code itself is not sent. This is ideal where sensitive files need to be signed, but should not be sent over the wire for signing. CodeSignTool is also ideal for automated batch processes for high volume signings or integration into existing CI/CD pipeline workflows.

Docker image is used for code signing with CircleCI. Detailed information: https://github.com/bayrakmustafa/codesigner-docker

# Usage (Job)

<!-- start usage -->
```yaml
codesigner-sign-artifact:
    # Create an environment variable
    environment:

### Environment Variables

* `USERNAME`: SSL.com account username. (**Required**)

* `PASSWORD`: SSL.com account password (**Required**)

* `CREDENTIAL_ID`: Credential ID for signing certificate. If credential_id is omitted and the user has only one eSigner code signing certificate, CodeSignTool will default to that. If the user has more than one code signing certificate, this parameter is mandatory. (**Required**)

* `TOTP_SECRET`: OAuth TOTP Secret. You can access detailed information on https://www.ssl.com/how-to/automate-esigner-ev-code-signing (**Required**)

* `ENVIRONMENT_NAME` : 'TEST' or 'PROD' Environment. (**Required**)

### Inputs

* `input_file_path`: Path of code object to be signed. (**Required**)

* `output_dir_path`: Directory where signed code object(s) will be written. If output_path is omitted, the file specified in -file_path will be overwritten with the signed file.
